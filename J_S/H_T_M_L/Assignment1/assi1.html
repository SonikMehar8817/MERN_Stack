    <h2>About the book</h2>
    <p>
      It advocates the importance of financial literacy (financial education),
      financial independence and building wealth through investing in assets,
      real estate investing, starting and owning businesses, as well as
      increasing one's financial intelligence (financial IQ).

    <h2>Why I Love It</h2>
    <p>
      At its core, Rich Dad Poor Dad is a book about financial education. It
      teaches readers how to think about money in a different way, how to build
      wealth, and how to achieve financial independence. But it does so in a way
      that is accessible, engaging, and easy to understand.
